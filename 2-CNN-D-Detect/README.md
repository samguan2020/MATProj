# Real-Time-Sleepiness-Detection-System-
The Real-Time Sleepiness Detection System is an AI-based project that detects a driver's sleepiness level in real-time and provides warnings to prevent potential accidents. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the driver's facial features, eye movements to determine their sleepiness level.
